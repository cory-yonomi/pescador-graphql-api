## User Story

I am an angler, either hobbyist, journeyman, professional, or guide. I need a resource that provides up-to-date information about the waters I fish. I
need up-to-date and forecast weather conditions and moon phases. I need a central location to save information about my fishing trips including weather,
stream conditions, tackle, and fish caught.

I would like to see the measuring stations within a range of my current location or a placed pin.
